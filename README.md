# python-challenge

Introduction
This set of challenges determines one's Python skills through different tasks and goals to complete. For the first challenge, we are tasked to analyze financial records to determine the total of different variables. Based on the results, we are able to reach a conclusions. For the second challenge, we are asked to analyze the poll data and votes across different candidates to determine which candidate was the winner.

Overview of the Data
For the first challenge, PyBank, the tasks that we are asked to calculate include the total number of months included in the dataset, the total amount of "Profit/Losses", the average of the changes in this category, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period.The dataset is composed of "Date" and "Profit/Losses", which will be used to the advantage of solving the tasks. 
For the second task, PyPoll, the datased is composed of Voter ID, Count, and Candidate. Our purpose is to modernize the vote counting process and to determing the total number of votes cast, list of candidates, percentage of votes that each candidate won, total number of votes, and lastly, the winner of the election. The data for this experiment comes from a small, rural town where elections are beh=ing held.

    Data Limitations
    Some of the limitations existing in the first challenge is the fact that we are calculating data for a total of seven years. The task is not asking one to calculate the profit/loss over one year, and determine patterns drawn for each year. This could eventually create reliable and valuable data for the company to show its growth or decline over the seven years. 
    In the second experiment, one of the limitations considered would be that we do not have the population number for each county. Having the data for each county will help us determine how many people did not vote, and we could even include the percentage of voters in that county. A lot of more data could be discovered by just adding one more variable.

Methods 
For both experiments, the script to read and import the csv files had to be used. I took advantage of the 'dictionaries' skills to combine the candidates name as well as the votes. I used that to my advantage to combine the variables, rather than having to identify them every time. It was important to iterate through rows and columns for both challenges due to the mass amount of data, therefore, leading us with more accurate data. Scripts such as these are the ones I found the most useful, and was able to accomplish each task by dividing it into smaller categories. 
As far as analysis goes, based on data for PyBank, the results showed that the greatest increase in profit was February of 2012, with an increase of $1,926,159, whereas the greatest decrease was in September of 2013, with a decrease of $2,196,167. For the second challenge, there was a total of 3,521,001 votes, with the majority of them voting for Khan. Khan's votes made up 63% of all of the votes. Instead of counting and tallying each vote for the corresponding candidate, we were able to use a much faster and effective tool that gave us the same reading. 

Conclusions
In conclusion, different scripts could be used in Python to determine data, and reach a conclusion based on that. Python is widely used, and extremely beneficial with large databases such as the csv files that were provided for us. These skills can be used in other real-life problems besides calculating the total amount of Profits/Losses and total number of votes.
